## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
* **Manual Memory Management:** `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`.
* **Binary Manipulation:** Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `<<`, `>>`), Hex dumps.
* **File Systems:** Parsing CSV, manipulating BMP headers, binary serialization.
* **Data Structures:** Custom structs, arrays, pointers.

## 🤖 AI Usage Transparency Statement
In the spirit of honest engineering, I want to disclose the level of AI assistance used during this 14-day sprint:

* **Phase 1 (Logic & Algorithms):** **Low Assistance.**
    * Most logic was implemented independently. AI was used primarily for syntax checking and optimizing loop structures.
* **Phase 2 (Memory & Pointers):** **Moderate Assistance.**
    * Concepts like Structs were self-derived, but I relied on AI to debug Segmentation Faults and verify correct `malloc`/`free` usage.
* **Phase 3 (Files & Systems):** **High Assistance.**
    * *The Brutal Truth:* The low-level logic for Steganography (Bitwise manipulation) and Hex Viewing (Memory offsets) was heavily guided by AI. While I typed and understood the implementation, the core algorithmic design for these specific systems was generated with significant help.
    * *Next Steps:* I am currently revisiting these specific topics ("The Bitwise Bootcamp") to ensure I can replicate this logic on a whiteboard without assistance.
