- [ ] **03. Statistical Number Cruncher** (Sorting Algorithms, Math)
- [ ] **04. Credit Card Validator** (Luhn Algorithm)
- [ ] **05. Conway’s Game of Life** (Cellular Automata, State Management)

### Phase 2: Structures, Pointers & Strings
- [ ] **06. Student Record System** (Structs, CRUD Operations)
- [ ] **07. Recursive Maze Solver** (Backtracking, Recursion)
- [ ] **08. Custom String Library** (Pointer Arithmetic, Memory Manipulation)
- [ ] **09. Hangman Game** (String Masking, State)
- [ ] **10. Bitwise Permissions Manager** (Bitwise Flags, XOR/AND/OR)

### Phase 3: Files, Bitwise & Advanced Systems
- [ ] **11. Save Game System** (Serialization, Binary I/O)
- [ ] **12. Run-Length Encoding** (Compression, File Logic)
- [ ] **13. CSV Data Parser** (Parsing, String Tokens)
- [ ] **14. Steganography** (Bit Manipulation, Binary Files)
- [ ] **15. Hex Dump Viewer** (Memory offsets, Buffer handling)

## How to Compile
Each project is self-contained. Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
gcc main.c -o output
./output
